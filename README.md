### HR API

A Spring Boot API backend by MongoDB for data. The Spring Data MongoDB project is used to interact with MongoDB.

#### Running the API

The application uses the .env pattern to resolve the application configuration values. Copy the configuration parameters from the `dist.env` file into a new file `.env` and supply the values for MongoDB instance connection and the database.

Swagger is available for the APIs on http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui/index.html. Change the port accordingly if you've started the application on a different one.
